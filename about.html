  <h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
  <p>
    I am Shaik Madeena, a passionate <strong>Java Full Stack Developer</strong> skilled in building modern, responsive, and scalable applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Java, Spring Boot, and SQL.  
    <br><br>
    <p>My name is <strong>Shaik Madeena</strong>, and Iâ€™m from <strong>Suryapet</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pursuing my <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering</strong> from <strong>Bhoj Reddy Engineering College for Women</strong>.</p>

<p>I completed my <strong>Intermediate at Suguna Junior College</strong>, and my <strong>schooling at Nagarjuna High School</strong>.</p>

<p>I have <strong>strong technical skills</strong>, particularly in <strong>Java, Python, SQL</strong>, and web development technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m focused on becoming a <strong>well-rounded developer</strong> by working on both <strong>front-end and back-end technologies</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked on several projects that reflect my practical skills:</p>

<p>â€¢ Developed a <strong>YouTube Transcript Summarizer</strong> with Python and NLP, featuring PDF generation and multi-language support.</p>

<p>â€¢ Developed a <strong>Heart Attack Prediction system</strong> using retina images to help detect early signs of heart disease.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also completed a <strong>Web Development Hackathon</strong>, a <strong>Front-End Internship at Bluestock</strong>, and participated in a <strong>Bootcamp and Hackathon on AWS</strong>, all of which helped strengthen my practical exposure and teamwork.</p>

<p>Apart from technical growth, I actively participate in extracurriculars. Iâ€™ve received:</p>

<p>ðŸ’ƒ A <strong>prize for a dance performance</strong></p>
